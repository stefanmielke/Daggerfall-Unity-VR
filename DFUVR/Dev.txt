TODO list:

use weapon timing to repeat attack

collision with some weapons from WISA not working

able to use 2 weapons when one on each hand
- when off hand free, show a hand to swap
- when off hand occupied, show the other weapon
- grabbing that swaps to that thing
- impossible with shield (then shield equipped on off hand automatically)

how to get other types of interactions working (steal, grab, info, watch?)
- alt + right stick

wearable lanterns and torches
https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/391

spell selection menu
or quick menu with hand, like quick slots or like Skyrim/alyx

fix skybox
today the sky is inverted and quite wrong. fix it in Y coord and put it as far as possible to the background

bow and arrow
- bow on off hand
- get arrow on main hand quiver

hold weapons with 2 hands (if weapon is 2 handed)

weight on weapons
use weight directly from weapons

better compass and health
removing the fake blocks with actual hud

proper VR hands
still show hand when not holding weapon

menu interactions by grabbing things on the body
- book to check quests
- map for map
- compass for local map
- pouch for inventory
- travel
- character sheet

some ui screens as interactive things
- char sheet as a piece of paper
- map as an actual map
- log and notebooks as notebooks
other hand used to navigate where needed (so equipping only 1 single hand weapon could be better?)
some screens should still be full screen to stop gameplay

min speed to cause attack to trigger
speed increases damage (increases minimum damage, do not touch max)

remove self from triggering hits from weapon
filter on the collision method

better settings file
- add "setting=value"

fix keyboard numbers

better death
- disable weapons
- maybe red tint on screen?

make max attacks based on the weapon stats

fix loading screen being right next to your face

move scroll bar with sticks

improve turning speed of the sheath

improve joystick handling on the code

show what the controls do when holding the alt button

toggle run

easier way to quick save and load

hide weapon on menu
